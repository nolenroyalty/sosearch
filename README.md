sosearch
========
Fun script for searching stack overflow within vim.  When run, prompts for a search query or uses the current line.  Retrieves the first 15 search results for that query and allows the user to cycle through them.  User is able to open the current question in their browser while viewing queries.  Displays results on-screen and cleans up after itself.  Requires python for vim.

Usefullness level: 1/10
Neat little project level: 6/10
Fun writing absurd regexs level: 15/10

I'm sure it can be done in a much better way than via regex, but that wasn't the point of the project!
